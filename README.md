# Soccermetrics Project Data

This repository contains data and code in support of some of the projects and articles on the [Soccermetrics website](http://www.soccermetrics.net).  It is inspired by [FiveThirtyEight's repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) that makes available the data behind some of their stories and graphics.

It is our hope that these data and tools will be used by others in the soccer analytics community to check our work and provide a launching point for their own projects and graphics.  We encourage others to do the same, and if you are already doing so, [please send us a link](mailto:info@soccermetrics.net) and we will add it to this README.
